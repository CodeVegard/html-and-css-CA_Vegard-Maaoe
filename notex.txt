Here's what I want to do in my CMS CA:
1. Give users the ability to select all items, or only items in stock, on Sale, or both
2. Improve the "Featured products" section, to display a scrollable DOM element when there are more than 3 items
3. Either remove fake "Image Gallery" on product page or remove it - REMOVED
4. Create a search function based on tags and/or product names.
5. Make a proper loading animation where relevant - DONE

Make sure product stock status is displed at all relevant points;
-Front page (Works)
-All products page (Works)
-Single product page (Works)
-Checkout (Works)

ALL THAT'S LEFT is making a search / filter function. Will look into that next week.
