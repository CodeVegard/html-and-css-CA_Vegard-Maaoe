Here's what I want to do in my CMS CA:
1. Give users the ability to select all items, or only items in stock (WORKS), on Sale, or both
    - Works on jackets.html page, needs work on index, product page and the checkout page
    - At the moment, products that are not in stock will not display on the Featured page
2. Improve the "Featured products" section, to display a scrollable DOM element when there are more than 3 items
3. Either remove fake "Image Gallery" on product page or remove it - likely to remove, hard to create properly and not needed for the CA
4. Create a search function based on tags and/or product names.
5. Make a proper loading animation where relevant 

Make sure product stock status is displed at all relevant points;
-Front page
-All products page (Works)
-Single product page 
-Checkout
