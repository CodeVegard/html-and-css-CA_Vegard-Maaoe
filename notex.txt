Here's what I want to do in my CMS CA:
1. Give users the ability to select all items, or only items in stock, on Sale, or both - In stock works
2. Improve the "Featured products" section, to display a scrollable DOM element when there are more than 3 items
3. Either remove fake "Image Gallery" on product page or remove it - REMOVED
4. Create a search function based on tags and/or product names.
5. Make a proper loading animation where relevant - DONE

WHAT WORKS
- Front page 
- All products page 
- Single product page 
- Checkout 
- The filter for jackets that are in stock on jackets.html 
- The filter for jackets that are on sale on jackets.html
- Show prices on Featured products list 
    - Make sure the on sale or out of stock text shows where relevant
- Make sure products on sale are displayed as such on products.html and checkout.html

ALL THAT'S LEFT
- Considering making a sort by price button.
- Fix CSS so that footer actually goes to the bottom on vertical desktop screens 
- On checkout.html, make a shipping address option ~~~ Optional
