# Cross-Course Assignment

## Description

This project was made as part of several assignments for my Front-End Developer
studies at Noroff Fagskole. 

The aim of the site was to understand and learn about HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
as well as undestanding the WordPress REST API. 

The content is managed with WooCommerce via headless WP as the CMS, and I use JavaScript to dynamically populate the site.

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript 
- WordPress REST API (headless)

## Installation

No installation needed, I have only been using vanilla variants of HTML, CSS and JS. Clone the repo, open it in VSCode and run it via Live Server to have a look around. Alternatively, go to the live site:
